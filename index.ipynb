    "\n",
    "Camera traps offer vital information about an ecosystem for wildlife management. The manual sorting of hundreds of thousands of images however, is a labor intensive process and puts a constraint on the amount of information that can be extracted in a reasonable amount of time. If there were a way to automatically sort images with algorithms, more could be captured and more information could be extracted. \n",

    "\n",
    "* __How?__\n",
    "\n",
    "The code here in written in Python and is built off the of the Pytorch library using Fastai [(course v3)](https://course.fast.ai/part2) as a guide. We're using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for our model architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Warning__\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation lays out the project but does not include the actual data or trained models. Hopefully, this implementation offers a practical guide and will be reusable on other species of animals / datasets with similar characteristics (i.e. camera traps). "
